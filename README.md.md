## Dataset

> The dataset is comprised of 81 variables and contains 113937 entries about the borrowers such as monthly income, is home owner or not etc and the loans borrowed such as rosper score,loan amount,repayment period etc. The main feature of interest from the dataset is the Prosper Score which is custom risk score built using historical Prosper data. The score ranges from 1-10, with 10 being the best, or lowest risk score. Visualizations on how the other variables affects it and inferences to be made.



## Summary of Findings
Some of the useful insights from findings of the distributions are;

> The distribution of original loans taken against income ranges is pretty much the same for both home owners and non with higher loan amaounts going for ($100,000+)  income range and the least at ranges $1-24999. The higer the income range the higher the loan amount disbursed.

> Prosper rating E of longer terms 36 and 60 has the higest Borrower rates as compared to prosper rating A and AA with the least Borrower rates for all the terms.

> Loan amounts for employed and self employed are quite higher with Home owners taking much more than those with no homes. Retirees tends to take little home but generally owning a home guarantees much larger loans.

> With respect to Prosper scores or ratings as that is my main variable of interest, it is a main factor in determining the interest rates charged on the loans,whether high or lower. This is also evident in the amount of loans since amount of loans disbursed also correlated to the rates.

>Prosper rating and estimated rating has a correlation r=-0.96, higher ratings means lower loss realised by the loans. This is a inverse in the correlation between the estimated loss and both Borrower Rate and Borrower APR as increase in the rates causing an increase in loss realised on the loans.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The presentation presents visualizations of different kinds of vriables,from univariate plots as bar plots to bivariate plots and univariate plots of different kind of variables to arrive at the relationships and correlations between the variables using plots as heatmaps,box plots,violing plots just to mention.
